The equals method in the Employee class is incorrectly implemented. It should accept an Object parameter instead of an Employee parameter, as it is meant to override the equals method from the Object class. Due to the current implementation not overriding Object.equals(), Java's default equality checking mechanism will not utilize this method. Consequently, the equals method in Employee class does not override the Object.equals() method, which means that the expected comparison behavior will not be executed when you invoke .equals(). Instead of functioning as an override, it will be treated as a standard method.
