a:
In order to resolve the diamond conflict, Java requires D to either explicitly override the conflicting method by giving its own implementation or by using the super keyword to specify which implementation to call.

b:
Java 8 allows interface D to declare a default method to address conflicts that may arise. If D cannot resolve these conflicts, it is required that the implementing classes provide an implementation.
