In the Employee class, there is no implementation of hashCode. The hashCode() method guarantees that two objects that are regarded as equal will yield a similar value for the hash code, which is necessary for a HashMap to work. Employee class ought to implement both equals and hashcode in order for the removeDuplicates() method to work properly with HashMap and the test method listsAreEqual() to compare the lists of Employee objects properly.
