Equals method in employee class checks visited as part of equality check, but removeDuplicates must check only name and salary for duplicates. One possibility is to change equals and hashCode in Employee to omit visited.

The ListsAreEqual method invokes the contains function, which relies on the equals method of the Employee class that takes into account the visited attribute. The lists will not be identical because the elements in dupsRemoved have their visited attribute initialized to false, whereas certain elements in the answer list may have their visited attribute set to true due to the setVisited method. To resolve this issue, modify the equals method to exclude the visited attribute or create a custom equality check that compares only the name and salary attributes of the Employee class.
